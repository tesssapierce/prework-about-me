      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a 27 year old woman living in Arvada, Colorado.  I have 2 dogs and 2 cats and live with my partner who is also in the tech field.  I enjoy artwork, music, and problem solving.  I am frequently playing video games, out on hikes, or playing guitar.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, but have lived in Minnesota, Texas, and Colorado.  I went to college in Denton, Texas at the University of North Texas and spent most of my life in Fort Worth, Texas.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy creating artwork with paint or embroidery, listening to or creating music, and spending time with my pets.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I want to work for a company that has a greater purpose and wants to better the world.  I want to contribute to society whether it be in social service or justice, environmentally, or empowering companies that are pursuing these qualities.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Arvada, Colorado, right outside of Denver.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have spent 5 years in the digital marketing space and have found that I am always drawn to the back end of the process.  My career has taken me from site management to email to feed management, all of which have given me different tastes of the technology career path.  I want to learn to develop so that I can have a job that I enjoy and constantly challenges me.</p>
